        <p className="mb-4">
          The FHS Distinguished Alumni Hall of Honor was established in 2012 to recognize graduates
          with exceptional career achievements and to inspire present-day students to establish their
          own goals, knowing that they can start at FHS, compete equally with the best the world has to
          offer and accomplish great things with their lives.

          <p className="mb-4">
            To date 18 FHS graduates have been selected for induction into the Hall of Honor, with
            graduation years ranging from 1932 to 1997. While 65 years separate their graduation dates,
            the keys to success they cited had remarkably common themes that remained timeless across
            the decades â€” a good education, continual learning, strong values, a focus on goals and, most
            of all, hard work.

        <p className="mb-4">
          Inductees were nearly unanimous in commenting on what a blessing it was to grow up in
          Fredericktown, a small, tight-knit community with one school system, where most students go
          through 12 years with the same classmates. And where the whole community was rooting for
          their success and keeping an eye on them, with parents often warning that everyone in
          Fredericktown would know if they did wrong even before they got home. Inductees said that
          with time and experience they have come to realize how very special their Fredericktown years
          were and what a positive impact the community had on their lives and careers.

          The inductees say that they are funding this scholarship to help the future generations of
          Freddies to continue their educational journeys based on the values of a Fredericktown
          foundation.
