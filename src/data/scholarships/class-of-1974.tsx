        The FHS Alumni Association is pleased to announce that the "Class of 1974" has funded the 37th fully endowed "Freddies Helping Freddies" scholarship that will be awarded annually beginning in 2025.
      </p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        Their 50th Class Reunion was the catalyst for this generous gift. The Class established a Reunion Planning Committee with regular meetings where memories poured forth, ideas were discussed, and plans were made.
      </p>

      <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 text-school-red">Class Distinctions</h4>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        While the Class knew that they were the first to have members travel daily to the Knox County Career Center, many were surprised to learn they still hold the record as the largest FHS graduating class with 124 members.
      </p>

      <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 text-school-red">Educational Journey</h4>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        The Class received their education in four different school locations over their 13-year history. They started kindergarten in the basement of the Baptist Church, moved to the multi-building campus by the old water tower for grades one through six; then Junior High at the former Taylor Street school, and, finally, High School at the current Administration Building on Sparta Road.
      </p>

      <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 text-school-red">Achievements and Activities</h4>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        The Class recalled their excellent sports teams, with their senior football and baseball teams both being inducted to the Freddie Sports Hall of Fame; and the band winning all the "halftime shows" and many competitions.
      </p>

      <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 text-school-red">Social Life and Memories</h4>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        The Class was close knit and friendly. Peppy's Pizza was the most popular hangout, with Fink's Drug Store and Beck's Point Drive-In getting honorable mentions. Dances at the school and movies at the two Mount Vernon theaters provided week-end relaxation. Some other highlights were the Senior trip to Cedar Point and a week of field study at the Mohican Outdoor School.
      </p>

      <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 text-school-red">A Different Era</h4>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        They noted how much things have changed since their schooldays. The revolution in technology being prominent; in 1974 there was no internet, no personal computers, no cell phones. They used the Dewey Decimal System to find the books and information needed to write papers and prepare for exams; their education was focused on the core skills of reading, writing and arithmetic which produced 15 Honor Students.
      </p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        They mostly rode the bus or walked to school, very few had cars. They recalled having so much freedom with no parents looking over their shoulders, but recalling how most every out of bounds behavior was swiftly reported to their parents by a caring community.
      </p>

      <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 text-school-red">Advice for Future Freddies</h4>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        They discussed what advice they had for the up-and-coming Freddies for a happy and successful life. Their consensus was insightful and familiar:
      </p>
      
      <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mb-4 space-y-2">
        <li>Trust in the Lord</li>
        <li>Pray</li>
        <li>Listen to good advice</li>
        <li>Learn your trade</li>
        <li>Work hard</li>
        <li>Persevere through the tough spots</li>
        <li>Enjoy your life's journey</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 text-school-red">Paying It Forward</h4>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        They agreed that it was a blessing to grow up in Fredericktown with good schools, good teachers and a supportive community. In discussing how to celebrate their good fortune, the Reunion Committee unanimously adopted a suggestion to conduct a fund drive among their classmates to establish this "Freddies Helping Freddies" scholarship to "pay it forward" to help the future generations of Freddies.
