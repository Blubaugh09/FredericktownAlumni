        The Fredericktown High School Alumni Association is pleased to announce their 31st fully endowed scholarship. This Scholarship, which will be first awarded to a 2024 FHS graduate, was funded by Dr. Robert Ronk & Patricia Hines Ronk to help the next generations of Fredericktown graduates with their post-high school education.

      <p className="mb-4">
        "It was such a blessing to grow up in Fredericktown", the Ronks said. "We had good schools, good teachers and coaches that provided us with a safe and encouraging environment. Now that we have completed our work careers, we want to pay it forward to the next generations of Fredericktown students. After thinking about the best approach for us to express our gratitude to the community in some meaningful way, we decided that continuing to support 'Freddies Helping Freddies' with a new scholarship made the most sense to us."

      <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 text-school-red">Early Life and Community Roots</h4>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        Dr. Ronk and Patricia both grew up on farms east of Fredericktown. They met at an early age as both of their families were members of the rural Berlin Methodist Church. They were known to all as "Bob Ronk" and "Pat Hines" as there are not many formalities in the Fredericktown community, just a lot of mutual respect and friendships.
      </p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        Bob and Pat learned their work ethic and Christian values from their parents. They enjoyed their twelve school years where they were good students and participated in a full array of activities including multiple sports, school plays, band, and cheerleading. Some of Bob's best memories were the lifetime friendships he developed while playing quarterback on the undefeated 1959 football team. Pat was a member of the National Honor Society and various school organizations.

      <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 text-school-red">Education and Career Paths</h4>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        After high school, Bob attended Ohio State University School of Dentistry for seven years and Pat went into the working world joining the office staff at Cooper-Bessemer. They married while Bob was in Dental School and Pat got her "PHT Degree - Putting Hubby Through". After Dental School, Dr. Ronk joined the Navy as a Dental Officer and was stationed at The Jacksonville Florida Naval Air Station for two years.

      <p className="mb-4">
        During that time Dr. Ronk decided that a career as an Orthodontist would be more enjoyable and rewarding. He attended the University of Pittsburgh School of Orthodontics for an additional two years.

      <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 text-school-red">Professional Practice and Family</h4>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        In 1970 Dr. Ronk opened the first full time Orthodontic practice in Knox County with Dr. Ronk serving the patients and Pat assisting as office manager. Dr. Ronk practiced for thirty-eight years. The Ronks say their most enjoyable and important life accomplishment was rearing their three children - Travis, Tara, and Lindsay. Their family has now grown to include six grandchildren who all live in Charlotte, North Carolina.

      <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 text-school-red">Return to Fredericktown</h4>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        The Ronks love of rural life prompted them to buy the old Hines Family farm in Fredericktown and make it their retirement home. Bob enjoys the outdoors and maintaining the property and Pat feels at home there. They spend their winter months in the warmer climate of Charlotte, NC with their family.
