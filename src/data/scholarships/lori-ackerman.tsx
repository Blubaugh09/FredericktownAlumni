            Mrs. Ackerman or "Mrs. A", as many so fondly called her, was truly special. She was more than just a teacher. She was your biggest cheerleader, a caring voice, a guiding hand, and a friend. Because she had two daughters in The Class of 1988, our class felt a connection to her and her to us, watching us grow throughout the years, culminating with her serving as our Senior Class Advisor.

      <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 text-school-red">More Than Just a Teacher</h4>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        She taught us more than just Western Civilization and Government. As seniors, she taught us how to start becoming adults, something she didn't just do for our class. She touched the lives of countless students who came before and after us. Lori loved teaching and truly making a difference in someone's life.
      </p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        She was born to Hungarian immigrants of whom she would say "instilled discipline with lots of love". This led to her natural desire to go into teaching. In 1959, she earned her Bachelor's Degree in Education from the Indiana University of Pennsylvania and later earned a Master's Degree in Education from Ashland University. Her greatest fulfillment was being an esteemed mentor and teacher to many, teaching for over forty years before retiring in June of 2000.
      </p>

      <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 text-school-red">Community Leadership</h4>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        All the students who knew her were so blessed that her journey included and ended at Fredericktown High School. Teaching was never enough though, as she proudly made Fredericktown her home and exemplified the civic-minded values that she instilled in her students.
      </p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        She served on the Fredericktown and Knox County Boards of Education, the Education Service Center Board, and the Ohio School Board. She was a member of the Ohio Retired Teachers Association, Fredericktown Community Development Foundation, the Fredericktown Senior Activity Center, and the Fredericktown Bicentennial committee.
      </p>

      <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 text-school-red">Scholarship Criteria</h4>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        Ideally, the students who receive this scholarship, much like The Class of 1988, should strive to be friends with all and work to better the community. They should be strong academic performers, while at the same time being involved in a variety of extra-curricular activities that benefit not only themselves, but also the school and the larger community. The students should be the living embodiment of the ideals to which Lori encouraged all her students to aspire.
      </p>
