            As the first born of John and Mae (Burkholder) Weller, Ula's 
            bright eyes were an early indicator of her intelligence. She 
            could read by the time that she was 3 years old and, when she 
            went to school, she was immediately placed in second grade. With her kind nature, Ula helped teach 
            other students in the one room schoolhouse to read. Completing 12 years of school in 11 years, she 
            graduated at age 16 and hoped to become a nurse, only to find out that the nursing school required 
            matriculating students to be 18 years old.

        Since education was important to her, Ula enrolled in The 
        Mount Vernon School of Business. Following graduation, she worked in the offices of Gregg 
        Manufacturing in Fredericktown, a company making lamps and furnishings. She handled accounting 
        functions. Her employment continued after her marriage to a neighboring farm boy, Chester Leedy, 
        until they started their family of three daughters: Bonita, Barbara, and Barrie.

      <p className="mb-4">
        She worked with her husband on the farm and, occasionally, part time in the community in various 
        capacities. When her husband experienced ill health as a farmer, they mortgaged the farm and 
        purchased The Rose Garden Nursing Home in Mount Vernon. Together they combined their skills to 
        operate this business for many years. She was the administrator, managing the daily operations of 
        hiring, scheduling, supervising, purchasing, accounting, and regulations. While she was not the nurse 
        that she dreamed of being, she worked with nurses to provide care for the residents. Ula showed her 
        compassion when she often stayed late holding someone's hand who was ill and had no family or 
        who was transitioning from this life into the next. This caregiving business was a combination of her 
        one-time desire to be a nurse, as well as using her education and experience in business and 
        management.

        Ula Weller Leedy was an active church member, who lived her faith. As a capable, kind, loving, 
        nurturing mother, family was very important. As the oldest in her family of origin, she looked after 
        her 4 siblings. Family visits were frequent and fun and laughter were the order of the day. A caring, 
        generous person, she daily sent extra money to school with two of her daughters to pay for milk for 
        children of one of her classmates who lived in less fortunate circumstances.

        Ula Weller Leedy (5/16/19 - 11/16/88) was an educated woman for her time and she used her 
        education for herself, her family, and her community. Mrs. Leedy's education provided a career for 
        her and enabled their three daughters to graduate from college and have careers (two in education) 
        that helped support their families. To honor her memory and her recognition of the importance of an 
        education, the Ula Weller Leedy Scholarship was established by her daughter, Bonita Leedy Birkel, 
        and is part of the FHS Alumni Association Scholarship Endowment and awarded every year.
