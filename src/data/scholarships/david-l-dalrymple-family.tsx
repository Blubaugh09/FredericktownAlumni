            endowed scholarship has been established to honor the life of 1958
            FHS graduate David L. Dalrymple who became a role model in

        <div className="mb-6">
          <p className="mb-4">
            David, with his younger brother Richard, grew up on the
            Dalrymple family farm in Fredericktown. In high school, David
            excelled in the classroom, as a member of the school's academic
            competition teams, and played the clarinet in the high school band.
          </p>
          
          <p className="mb-4">
            After high school, David attended The College of Wooster, where he graduated in
            1962 with a major in Chemistry. He was an outstanding student at Wooster and a
            leader of Phi Delta Sigma, which was known as the "athletic fraternity". David, the
            academic, who decided to affiliate with the athletes, provided early insights into
            David's ability to lead, enjoy and earn the respect of a broad range of people and
            organizations.

      <div className="mt-8 bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-school-red mb-6">Academic Excellence</h3>
        
        <div className="mb-6">
          <p className="mb-4">
            David received his master's degree from MIT, started his PhD studies in organic
            chemistry at The Ohio State University and transferred with his research professor's
            group to the University of Vermont where he received his PhD. David then did his
            postdoctoral research with Nobel Laureate R. B. Woodward at Harvard.
          </p>
          
          <p className="mb-4">
            As a professor at the University of Delaware, David authored a college chemistry
            textbook before deciding to help lead the revolution in scientific instrumentation at
            Nicolet Instrument Corporation.

        <div className="mb-6">
          <p className="mb-4">
            David's work on the then nascent MRI technology provided a breakthrough in non-invasive 
            soft tissue diagnostics. Nicolet loaned David to General Electric for a 3-year
            stint to help them successfully bring the MRI technology to the mass medical market
            before returning to Nicolete to work on new groundbreaking challenges across many
            technologies.
          </p>
          
          <p className="mb-4">
            Through various corporate consolidations, Nicolete eventually became a
            part of Thermo Fisher Scientific, with David remaining with the company throughout
            his career. Thermo Fisher Scientific continues as a world leader in analytical
            instruments and is still benefiting from David's patented work relating to MRI and
            Hearing Aid technologies.

        <h4 className="font-semibold mb-3">Return to Fredericktown</h4>
        <p className="mb-4">
          After retirement, David returned to Fredericktown to be close to family and enjoy
          their traditions. David immediately became involved in the local activities, including
          optimizing the process for producing the superb "Dalrymple Family Maple Syrup", 
          making frequent blood donations to the Red Cross, and preparing pro-bono income
          tax returns for retirees.

        <div className="mb-6">
          <p className="mb-4">
            Perhaps David's most lasting local contributions will be as the President of the FHS
            Alumni Association. Under David's leadership the Alumni Association established a
            bigger vision for the alumni's "Freddies Helping Freddies" scholarship fund. In eight
            years, under David's leadership the scholarship fund corpus grew from under $10,000
            with zero endowed scholarships to a corpus of over $750,000 with 28 fully endowed
            scholarships available for award or renewal every year.
          </p>
          
          <p className="mb-4">
            This 29th endowed scholarship is sponsored by David's brother, Richard, and will be
            first awarded in 2024. When Richard was asked what motivated his donation he said,
            "David accomplished so much in his life without fanfare, he shunned recognition and
            credit for anything he did. It is important that future generations of Freddies be
            inspired by David's life and realize that they can start at FHS and impact the whole
            world".
