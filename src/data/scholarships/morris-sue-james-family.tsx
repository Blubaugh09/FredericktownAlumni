        <div className="mb-6">
          <p className="mb-4">
            Morris James and Sue Jones met as schoolmates in Chesterville with Sue being younger by two
            years. Both were good students who took advantage of all the opportunities their small, rural
            school had to offer. Sue was a band member, a majorette, a cheerleader, and the salutatorian
            of her class; while Morris starred in 6-man football, basketball, and baseball; and became co-valedictorian 
            of his class because "Mom said that I had to!".
          </p>
          
          <p className="mb-4">
            After high school, Morris headed off to Capital University "because they had a strong science
            program". At Cap, Morris majored in Physics and Education while earning four letters as one of
            the stars on some of Cap's best football teams and, not surprisingly, was later named to the
            Highland High School Athletic Hall of Fame recognizing his accomplishments as a Chesterville
            Eagle.
          </p>
          
          <p className="mb-4">
            Sue postponed her college education until after their three daughters were all in grade school.
            Sue resumed her college education at The Ohio State University because Morris advised that
            "more education is our best life-insurance policy". After graduation, Sue taught in the
            Highland/Marengo elementary school system, mostly teaching the 5<sup>th</sup> grade, retiring after 25
            years of service.

            <h4 className="font-bold text-lg mb-3">Morris James</h4>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Morris started his teaching career at Fredericktown Schools in 1959; he had planned to stay for
              three years, but they all fell in love with the community and stayed on the job until he retired in
              1996. Morris started his career as a Physics, Science, and Math teacher and as an assistant
              football coach.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              During his thirty-seven-year tenure, Morris held the full range of teaching and
              leadership assignments, serving at various times as a teacher, coach, guidance counselor,
              elementary school principal, junior high principal, high school principal, and Superintendent.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Morris was respected by students, parents, and the community for his calm and even-handed
              teaching and leadership style. Many students have commented on how a "little discipline and a
              second or third chance from Mr. James" helped them get their lives on track.

            <p className="mb-4">
              Sue became an expert at juggling at an early age; first, as a full-time mom until the girls were all
              in school, then getting her college degree, and next launching her full-teaching career while
              continuing all the duties associated with being a wife and mom to three active daughters.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              After graduation from Ohio State, Sue taught in the Highland/Marengo elementary school system, 
              mostly teaching the 5<sup>th</sup> grade, retiring after 25 years of service.

        <h4 className="font-semibold mb-3">A Teaching Moment</h4>
        <p className="mb-4">
          When some high school students "TP-ed" the James home as a prank, Morris nabbed one
          "who was scared to death"; Morris called the offender by name and simply said, "I am
          appointing you as Chair of the Clean-Up committee; bring your buddies back here tomorrow
          morning". The kids came back, cleaned things up and everyone involved is still laughing about
          it.

      <div className="mt-8 bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-school-red mb-6">The James Family</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The daughters did all their schooling and graduated from Fredericktown High School; Vicky, who
          loved the piano and the band, in 1976; Carol, 1980, and Terri, 1982, both starred for the
          Freddies in volleyball and basketball. Not surprisingly, all three children followed their parents'
          footsteps into careers in education.
        </p>
        
        <p className="mb-4">
          Both Morris and Sue say that family remains at the center of their lives, taking great pride in
          being as involved as possible with their 11 grandchildren, 17 great-grandchildren, and 4 great-great-grandchildren. 
          Sue hosts the family meal every Sunday after church where 14 are
          typically in attendance. Sue reports that Holidays are even more fun when the dinner crowd
          swells to 30 with the out-of-town guests. For the past four decades, the entire Morris Family
          Clan (now numbering 40) heads off together for a week on a North Carolina beach.

        <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-school-red mb-6">Community Involvement</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          While busy with full-time jobs and three children to raise, Morris and Sue made time to get
          involved with the church and community right from the start; and have stepped up those
          efforts during their retirement years. Morris remains active in the Fredericktown Lions Club and
          Salvation Army and Sue with the Red Cross; each of them has received prestigious awards from
          those organizations recognizing their service.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Both have enjoyed a lifetime of deep involvement
          with the Fredericktown United Methodist Church where Sue was a leader on the "Hot Meals"
          team. Not surprisingly, in 1999 Morris and Sue were named the "Grand Marshalls of the
          Tomato Show Parade" which is widely recognized as the premier Lifetime Achievement Award
          for community service in Fredericktown.

        <p className="mb-4 italic">
          "Fredericktown has always had a strong school system where students
          graduate prepared for what comes next, but their future depends on them continuing to learn
          and grow. Whether it is a four-year college; vocational school, tech school, or community
          college, it is important that everyone keep learning. I spent my whole teaching career at
          Fredericktown and we have benefitted from living in this great community. Sue and I want to
          help Freddie grads with their next step in furthering their educations."
