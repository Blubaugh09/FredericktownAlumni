        "Ms. Weller cared very deeply about her students and was an inspiration to them both inside and outside the classroom for numerous reasons. Her dynamic teaching style made her a phenomenal educator", said Malcolm. "She was my inspiration for funding these series of four Women in STEM scholarships. I'm grateful for the excellent foundational education in both physics and chemistry that Ms. Weller provided to me before going to college. I encourage others who benefitted from Ms. Weller's tutelage, along with those who want to encourage women pursuing careers in STEM-related fields, to contribute to her scholarship."
