            The FHS Alumni Association is pleased to announce that a scholarship
            honoring the teaching career of Rachel A. Gregg (1967 â€“ 1992) has
            been fully endowed by Malcolm R. Shrimplin, an FHS graduate. The
            purpose of the scholarship is to encourage young women to further
            study science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).

          "I'm grateful for the encouragement shown to me by Mrs. Gregg while
          studying algebra and calculus before going to college", said Malcolm.
          "I attribute my academic and professional accomplishments to the
          solid educational foundation that Mrs. Gregg and other faculty at FHS
          provided to me and countless other students. I encourage others who
          benefitted from Mrs. Gregg's tutelage, along with those who want to
          encourage women pursuing careers in STEM-related fields, to
          contribute to this scholarship."

        <div className="mb-6">
          <h4 className="font-bold text-lg mb-3">Educational Background</h4>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Rachel graduated from Lenoir Rhyne College, Hickory, NC, with a major in chemistry and minors
            in biology, physics and mathematics. She pursued graduate work in chemistry at the University
            of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

          <h4 className="font-bold text-lg mb-3">Teaching Career</h4>
          <p className="mb-4">
            In the mid-1950's, she began her teaching career in Chesterville,
            OH where she taught high school biology, chemistry, physics, and both advanced and general
            mathematics, along with general science. In the mid-1960's, living in Fredericktown with her
            husband, Charles Gregg and children, Anne and Geoff, she was offered a teaching position in the
            Fredericktown school system.
          </p>
          
          <p className="mb-4">
            Accepting this position meant enrollment in Ashland College to
            complete coursework required for an Ohio teaching certificate. Reflecting on her twenty-five-
            year tenure at Fredericktown, she feels that our school offered excellent academics led by a
            dedicated teaching staff.

          <h4 className="font-bold text-lg mb-3">Teaching Philosophy</h4>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Her main goal was always to inspire students to discover their talents
            and to challenge them to work diligently to achieve personal success to the best of their abilities.
            As a woman, another important goal was to encourage her female students to acquire the skills
            and qualifications that enabled them to have a career that would provide them with economic
            independence.
          </p>
          
          <p className="mb-4">
            Rachel summarizes her sentiments this way, "With an education in the sciences,
            arts, mathematics and related fields, career opportunities abound. My wish is that I have been
            a positive force in helping my students achieve their goals."
