        Family holidays were special to Marjorie. She enjoyed preparing homegrown vegetable dishes and homemade desserts. She lived close to three of her six grandchildren and attended their school and community activities. Marjorie went on several senior bus trips and loved to experience new places of interest. She traveled to see the sights of New York City, Maine, Idaho and Washington State. She and gal pals spent many winters in and around Naples, Florida. The ladies frequented coastal shops, collected shells on sandy beaches and ate fresh seafood. At home, her daily companion was a schnauzer. Unfortunately, in December 2009, Marjorie became ill with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which took her life in February 2010- before her 78th birthday.
