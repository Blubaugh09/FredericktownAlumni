            Jean Braddock Carter gave the family their Fredericktown roots as a life-long resident and a
            1947 FHS graduate. Jean loved school and was a member of the National Honor Society while
            active in many school and church related functions. She even worked at the local bank part-time 
            during her school years, which provided an important career path later in life.

          <h4 className="font-bold text-lg mb-3">Jack Carter</h4>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Jack Carter, who had Gambier roots, was the quintessential good guy, solid citizen, and great
            father who never met a stranger. Jack was well known and well liked in the community. Jack
            and Jean raised their family on a small farm on Route 95 where hard work, Christian values and
            family time were their priorities. Money was short, but the love was plentiful.

          <h4 className="font-bold text-lg mb-3">Family Life</h4>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Jean, the love of Jack's life, concentrated on being a full-time mom and was very involved in the community.
            Jean made sure the family showed up as a unit each Sunday at the United Methodist Church;
            the kids school assignments were completed on time; and that their lessons were learned and
            understood. Jean was also an active volunteer at the Knox County Community Hospital, the
            Methodist Church, the Interchurch and the Fredericktown schools; and even made time for
            gardening which was a passion.

        <p className="mb-4">
          The Carter Family was disrupted when Jack suddenly passed of a heart attack in 1978 at the
          young age of 53. Gary, the youngest was still a teenager and Tom had just completed his
          second year of college. Jean stepped up in her time of grief to become the single mom who
          took the lead as the family breadwinner while encouraging her children to build their own lives.
          Jean put her earlier banking training to good use and worked another twenty years in the
          industry retiring in 1999.
