          <p className="mb-4">
            Lawrence Dalrymple, who was known by all as "Rusty", and his wife, Mary
            McClelland, a 1931 FHS graduate, married in 1938 eventually buying a farm located west of
            Fredericktown. Rusty had a long career in the trucking business as the Terminal Manager for
            Schlariet Transfer. Mary, after attending Lincoln Memorial University and Oberlin Business
            School, had a career at JC Penny before settling into the role of a full-time mom raising their
            two boys.

          <h4 className="font-bold text-lg mb-3">Community Involvement</h4>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Both Rusty and Mary were well known for providing willing helping hands to the community.
            Rusty was a long-serving member of the Fredericktown School Board and Mary was the School
            Board Clerk for over 20 years. Both were active in the Fredericktown First Presbyterian Church,
            Wayne Township administration, and the Wayne Grange.
          </p>
          
          <p className="mb-4">
            When something needed to be done
            in Fredericktown, Rusty and Mary were often on the scene. Their good works included projects
            for the Lion's Club, the Red Cross, and the Cancer Society; designing and building the landmark
            steeple on the Presbyterian church, and helping build the Fredericktown Library.
          </p>
          
          <p className="mb-4">
            In addition to big projects, Mary was well known for her baking and Rusty for his award-winning
            Maple Syrup. After his trucking career, Rusty took up driving a daily school bus route, and for
            over a decade, he also drove Freddie sports teams to their away games, typically providing the
            team with home-baked cookies made by Mary.

            <p className="mb-4">
              David was a 1958 graduate of Fredericktown High School, known for playing in the band and as
              one of the stars of the Scholarship teams. David studied Chemistry and Physics at the College of
              Wooster and received his Ph.D. in Chemistry from the University of Vermont.

            <p className="mb-4">
              In his career,
              David was a researcher at Harvard under a Nobel laureate, author of textbooks, and a college
              professor before settling in for a long career as a chemical engineer at a company that
              eventually became Thermo Fisher Scientific where he was awarded a major patent.

            <p className="mb-4">
              On
              retirement David returned to Fredericktown, becoming an active volunteer including annually
              completing income tax returns "pro bono" for the elderly and leading the Fredericktown High
              School Alumni Association to new levels as their President for eight years.

              Richard, a 1960 FHS graduate, started his business career as an electrician and worked for the
              telephone company, eventually buying the Redi-Mix Concrete plant in Fredericktown to
              become his own boss.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              When asked what motivated him to endow this scholarship, Richard said
              "I was looking for a way to permanently honor my parents and my brother. I would like the 
              Dalrymple Family Scholarship to be awarded to a Freddie who wants to follow in David's
              footsteps".

          The Dalrymple family exemplifies the spirit of community service and dedication to education that has made Fredericktown special. From Rusty's service on the School Board and as a bus driver, to Mary's role as School Board Clerk, to David's leadership of the Alumni Association, they have shown a multi-generational commitment to the Fredericktown schools and community.
