        <p className="mb-4">
          Gold Star Parents are mothers and fathers who have lost a son or daughter in active service 
          of the United States Armed Forces. The Gold Star symbol has been used by American families 
          to honor their loved ones killed in military service since World War I.

          This scholarship honors not only the ultimate sacrifice made by Fredericktown alumni in service 
          to their country, but also recognizes the enduring grief and sacrifice of the parents who raised these heroes.
