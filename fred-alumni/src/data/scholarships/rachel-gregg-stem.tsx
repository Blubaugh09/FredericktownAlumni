            "I'm grateful for the encouragement shown to me by Mrs. Gregg while studying algebra and calculus before going to college", said Malcolm. "I attribute my academic and professional accomplishments to the solid educational foundation that Mrs. Gregg and other faculty at FHS provided to me and countless other students. I encourage others who benefitted from Mrs. Gregg's tutelage, along with those who want to encourage women pursuing careers in STEM-related fields, to contribute to this scholarship."

      <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 text-school-red">Educational Background</h4>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        Rachel graduated from Lenoir Rhyne College, Hickory, NC, with a major in chemistry and minors in biology, physics and mathematics. She pursued graduate work in chemistry at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. In the mid-1950's, she began her teaching career in Chesterville, OH where she taught high school biology, chemistry, physics, and both advanced and general mathematics, along with general science.

      <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 text-school-red">Career at Fredericktown</h4>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        In the mid-1960's, living in Fredericktown with her husband, Charles Gregg and children, Anne and Geoff, she was offered a teaching position in the Fredericktown school system. Accepting this position meant enrollment in Ashland College to complete coursework required for an Ohio teaching certificate.
      </p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        Reflecting on her twenty-five-year tenure at Fredericktown, she feels that our school offered excellent academics led by a dedicated teaching staff. Her main goal was always to inspire students to discover their talents and to challenge them to work diligently to achieve personal success to the best of their abilities.

      <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 text-school-red">Empowering Women in STEM</h4>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        As a woman, another important goal was to encourage her female students to acquire the skills and qualifications that enabled them to have a career that would provide them with economic independence. Rachel summarizes her sentiments this way, "With an education in the sciences, arts, mathematics and related fields, career opportunities abound. My wish is that I have been a positive force in helping my students achieve their goals."
