            "I'm grateful for the year I spent learning various Pre-Calculus concepts from Mrs. Zagula", said Malcolm. "She was an excellent teacher who clearly cared about her students. The knowledge that I gained from Mrs. Zagula served me well when taking advanced math courses for both my undergraduate and graduate degrees. I encourage others who benefitted from Mrs. Zagula's tutelage, along with those who want to encourage women pursuing careers in STEM-related fields, to contribute to this scholarship."
