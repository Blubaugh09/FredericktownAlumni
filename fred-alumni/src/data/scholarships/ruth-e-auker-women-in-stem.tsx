            The FHS Alumni Association is pleased to announce that a scholarship
            honoring the teaching career of Ruth E. Auker (1978 â€“ 2003) has been fully
            endowed by Malcolm R. Shrimplin, an FHS graduate. To be awarded this
            spring, the purpose of this scholarship is to encourage young women to
            further study science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).

          "I'm grateful for the excellent foundational education in the biological
          sciences that Mrs. Auker provided to me before going to college", said
          Malcolm. "While I did not study the subject further, the knowledge that I
          gained from Mrs. Auker has served me well during my career in the biopharmaceutical industry.
          I encourage others who benefitted from Mrs. Auker's tutelage, along with those who want to
          encourage women pursuing careers in STEM-related fields, to contribute to this scholarship."

          <h4 className="font-bold text-lg mb-3">Educational Background</h4>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Ruth earned a Bachelor of Science in Secondary Education from Ohio University in January 1964.
            The next week she was teaching at East Knox high school where she met her late husband, Roger.
            She then taught at Fairfield Union and Mount Vernon high schools. For the next several years,
            she was a stay-at-home mom with her two children, Ellen, and Tim.

          <h4 className="font-bold text-lg mb-3">Fredericktown Years</h4>
          <p className="mb-4">
            In August 1978, she was hired to teach biology at Fredericktown High School. For 25 years at Fredericktown, she taught
            biology, anatomy/physiology, environmental science, and unified science. After her retirement
            in 2003, she continued as a substitute teacher for a few years.

          <p className="mb-4 italic">
            "I am proud to have been a member of the faculty where our goal was to prepare every student for her/his best possible
            future", said Auker.
          </p>
          
          <p className="mb-4">
            Many of her students have been very successful in their careers in STEM-related fields. Auker continues, "Having served on scholarship committees for Fredericktown
            Education Association and Knox Community Hospital Auxiliary, I know the impact receiving a
            scholarship has on a student's education goals. Awarding this scholarship to a young woman
            pursuing a career in a STEM-related field will make it easier for her to reach her goal. I am
            honored to be a part of this."

          This scholarship is the second in a series of four that are planned to honor teaching careers of
          female STEM teachers from Fredericktown High school and to encourage women to pursue
          careers in STEM-related fields. The first, the "Rachel A. Gregg Women in STEM Scholarship", was
          awarded in the spring of 2021.
