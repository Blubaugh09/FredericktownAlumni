            "I'm grateful for the excellent foundational education in the biological sciences that Mrs. Auker provided to me before going to college", said Malcolm. "While I did not study the subject further, the knowledge that I gained from Mrs. Auker has served me well during my career in the biopharmaceutical industry. I encourage others who benefitted from Mrs. Auker's tutelage, along with those who want to encourage women pursuing careers in STEM-related fields, to contribute to this scholarship."

        Ruth earned a Bachelor of Science in Secondary Education from Ohio University in January 1964. The next week she was teaching at East Knox high school where she met her late husband, Roger. She then taught at Fairfield Union and Mount Vernon high schools. For the next several years, she was a stay-at-home mom with her two children, Ellen, and Tim.

Awarding this scholarship to a young woman pursuing a career in a STEM-related field will make it easier for her to reach her goal. I am honored to be a part of this."
