            The FHS Alumni Association is pleased to announce that a scholarship
            honoring the teaching career of Catherine Zagula (1969-2009) has been
            fully endowed by Malcolm R. Shrimplin, an FHS graduate. To be awarded
            this spring, the purpose of this scholarship is to encourage young women
            to further study science, technology, engineering, and mathematics
            (STEM).

          "I'm grateful for the year I spent learning various Pre-Calculus
          concepts from Mrs. Zagula", said Malcolm. "She was an excellent teacher
          who clearly cared about her students. The knowledge that I gained from Mrs. Zagula served me
          well when taking advanced math courses for both my undergraduate and graduate degrees. I
          encourage others who benefitted from Mrs. Zagula's tutelage, along with those who want to
          encourage women pursuing careers in STEM-related fields, to contribute to this scholarship."

          This scholarship is the third in a series of four that are planned to honor teaching careers of
          female STEM teachers from Fredericktown High school and to encourage women to pursue
          careers in STEM-related fields. The first two, the "Rachel A. Gregg Women in STEM Scholarship"
          and the "Ruth E. Auker Women in STEM Scholarship", were awarded in the spring of 2021 and
          2022, respectively.
